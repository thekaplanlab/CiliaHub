CiliaHub: An Expanded Catalog of Human Ciliary Genes

CiliaHub is a scalable, user-friendly platform that significantly expands the known human ciliome by integrating automated literature mining with expert manual curation.

This repository hosts the data and information for the CiliaHub project, which provides a comprehensive, updated, and expanded catalog of human ciliary genes. The complete, searchable database is available at our project website:

➡️ https://theciliahub.github.io/

The established link between cilia and human disease has fueled a growing interest in identifying the complete "ciliome." Despite numerous efforts, the full extent of the human ciliary gene set remains unresolved, with many genes absent from curated databases.

CiliaHub addresses this gap by:

Automating Discovery: Systematically searching the PubMed database using gene symbols and cilia-related keywords (e.g., cilia, flagella, basal body) to identify potential ciliary genes.

Ensuring Accuracy: Applying a rigorous manual curation process where each automatically flagged gene is reviewed by independent experts to confirm its association with ciliary structures or function.

Expanding the Ciliome: Increasing the known human ciliary gene list from 688 (SYSCILIA Gold Standard v2) to over 2,000 curated genes.
